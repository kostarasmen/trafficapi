This is a guide to use Traffic API.

Although it's easy to use, i'd like to mention that the first number of a row in "traffictime.txt" stands for the green traffic level, the second for the orange traffic level and the last one for the red traffic level. (Every number is the average time between best and worst case scenario.)
